# Pong-Game

Welcome to **Pong-Game**! This project showcases a classic platform game developed using raylib and C++. It embraces the principles of object-oriented programming to create an engaging gaming experience.

## Gameplay

In Pong-Game, you take control of a character named Scarfy, navigating through a dynamic platform-based world. Your objective is to reach the finish line while avoiding enemies known as nebulas. The gameplay is both challenging and fun:

- **Controls**: Use the arrow keys (or `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`) to move Scarfy left and right. Press the spacebar to make Scarfy jump over the nebulas.

- **Obstacles**: Nebulas are the enemies in this game. Your goal is to avoid colliding with them by jumping over them. Colliding with a nebula results in a setback, so timing your jumps is essential.

## Features

Pong-Game comes with several exciting features that contribute to its gameplay and appeal:

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: The game is developed using object-oriented programming principles, promoting modularity and maintainability in the codebase.

- **Platform Gameplay**: The game is presented in a platformer style, where you control Scarfy's movements to overcome challenges and reach the finish line.

- **Animations**: Enjoy lively animations for Scarfy, the nebulas, and background scrolling, which adds visual richness to the gaming experience.
