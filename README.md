# Pong-Game

Welcome to **Pong-Game**! This project brings to life the classic Pong game using the raylib library and C++. Engage in an exciting player-vs-AI match where you'll test your skills against a dynamically calculating opponent.

## Gameplay

Pong-Game is a simple yet captivating game with familiar mechanics:

- **Controls**: Use the `W` and `S` keys (or arrow keys) to control your paddle's movement. The AI opponent intelligently calculates its position to return the ball.

- **Objective**: The objective is to prevent the ball from passing your paddle while trying to make it pass your opponent's paddle. Each successful pass earns you a point.

- **Endless Challenge**: The game continues indefinitely, with points accumulating endlessly. How long can you keep up the pace and outsmart the AI opponent?

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay**: Pong-Game faithfully recreates the timeless gameplay of the original Pong.

- **Player vs AI**: Challenge yourself against an AI opponent that dynamically calculates its movements to challenge your skills.
